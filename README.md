# Inventory Management Project

A Backend Java Application that allows the user to interact with a simple MySQL database for a shop.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

---

Install MySQL by <a href=https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html>clicking here</a>

Install Java by <a href=https://www.java.com/en/>clicking here</a>

---

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Running the tests is as simple as running the project as a JUnit test in Eclipse. The pom.xml contains all the dependencies neccessary to run the tests including JUnit and Mockito. The tests should appear next to the project explorer and break down the test classes and show if any tests have failed.

### Unit Tests

Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them

```
Unit testing through JUnit allows the application's source code to be tested in their smallest units possible, which are methods. Each method's output is verified against a predetermined result that is to be expected given any intial parameters or inputs have been selected. Mockito allows mocking objects in a test to check functionality of a method which relies on an instantiated object.
```

## Deployment

Deployment can be acheived using the precompiled Fat JAR file and a MySQL database
